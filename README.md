# Shorty

Super simple URL shortener using FastAPI and SQLite. It's based off of this
[wonderful tutorial on Real Python](https://realpython.com/build-a-python-url-shortener-with-fastapi/).
It has some additional features like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for
dependencies handling, ability to specify shortening code, broader shortening
options (case variants), Docker image and GitHub actions.
